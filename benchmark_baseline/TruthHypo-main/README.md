## Introduction
TruthHypo is a benchmark for assessing the capabilities of LLMs in generating truthful scientific hypotheses. This repo also contains the source code of KnowHD, a knowledge-based hallucination detector to evaluate how well hypotheses are grounded in existing knowledge. Our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14599) shows that LLMs struggle to generate truthful hypotheses. By analyzing hallucinations in reasoning steps, we demonstrate that the groundedness scores provided by KnowHD serve as an effective metric for filtering truthful hypotheses from the diverse outputs of LLMs.

## Usage
The TruthHypo dataset is directly accessible via [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/TruthHypo):
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

data = load_dataset("TruthHypo/edges_test")
```
